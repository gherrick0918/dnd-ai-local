# Sample Rules Pack (Test Content)

Purpose: This file exists to test ingestion, chunking, retrieval, and citation output.
It is NOT official D&D text. It is intentionally original, short, and structured.

## 1. The Core Loop

A round represents a short burst of action. Each round is broken into turns.  
During a turn, a creature usually does three things:
1) moves (optional),
2) performs one main action, and
3) may do a quick action if the scenario allows it.

Design note: This is a simplified test loop for software behavior, not a faithful copy of any ruleset.

## 2. Actions (Test Set)

Main actions (choose one on your turn):
- **Strike:** Make one attack roll using your best weapon or spell focus.
- **Cast:** Use a prepared spell or effect that targets a creature, area, or object.
- **Dash:** Double your movement for the turn.
- **Guard:** Gain +2 to defense checks until the start of your next turn.
- **Help:** Give an ally advantage on one check or attack they make before your next turn.
- **Use Item:** Consume or activate one item you carry.
- **Interact:** Pull a lever, open a door, draw a weapon, stow a weapon, etc.

Quick actions (0 or 1 per turn, if allowed by the current scene):
- **Shove aside:** Move a nearby creature 5 feet if you win an opposed check.
- **Snap shot:** Make a weak ranged attack that deals half damage.
- **Recall detail:** Ask the GM one focused question about what your character would likely know.

## 3. Movement and Positioning

Movement is measured in feet. If you do not have exact measurements, estimate with zones:
- **Near:** within a few steps
- **Far:** across the room
- **Distant:** requires significant travel or multiple turns

Difficult terrain halves movement.

## 4. Checks (Test Resolution)

When you attempt something risky, roll:
- d20 + relevant bonus

Compare the total to a Difficulty Class (DC):
- DC 10: easy
- DC 15: moderate
- DC 20: hard
- DC 25: extreme

If two creatures oppose each other, both roll and the higher total wins.

## 5. Advantage / Disadvantage (Test Mechanic)

Some situations grant an edge or a penalty.

- **Advantage:** roll two d20s and take the higher.
- **Disadvantage:** roll two d20s and take the lower.

If you have both advantage and disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out and you roll one d20.

## 6. Conditions (Test List)

Conditions apply ongoing effects until removed.

- **Stunned:** you lose your main action on your turn.
- **Slowed:** your movement is halved.
- **Weakened:** your damage is halved.
- **Marked:** the creature that marked you has advantage on attacks against you.
- **Inspired:** you may reroll one failed check, then the condition ends.

## 7. Healing and Resting

Healing restores hit points (HP).

- **Quick rest:** spend 10 minutes; regain a small amount of HP (GM decides a number).
- **Long rest:** spend 8 hours; restore HP to full and clear most conditions.

If a condition is ΓÇ£cursedΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£persistent,ΓÇ¥ it may require a special cure rather than rest.

## 8. Example Q&A Prompts (For Testing Retrieval)

Use these to test your CLI:
- ΓÇ£What does advantage do?ΓÇ¥
- ΓÇ£How do opposed checks work?ΓÇ¥
- ΓÇ£What does the Marked condition do?ΓÇ¥
- ΓÇ£What happens on a long rest?ΓÇ¥
- ΓÇ£What are the main actions?ΓÇ¥

Expected behavior: your system should answer using only the ingested text and cite the chunk IDs used.

## 9. Optional: Fake Source Metadata

Source label suggestion for testing:
- source: "Sample Rules Pack"
- title: "Sample Rules Pack (Test Content)"
- license: "Internal test content"
- attribution: "Created by the developer for ingestion tests"
