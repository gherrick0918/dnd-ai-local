Got it — I pulled up your newest terminal capture (terminalcapture_2026-01-16_1103.md) and everything is doing what we wanted:

buildandtest.ps1 runs clean (fmt, clippy, tests).

init-db reports schema v3.

ingest works (sample rules went in as a new document).

ingest-dnd5eapi works (25 spells + 25 monsters ingested).

search is working and returning chunk IDs + snippets.

show-chunk exists (great for debugging).

Two small “polish” items showed up in the log that are worth fixing before we add ask:

1) Why search "Armor Class" returned nothing

Your monster renderer writes - AC: {ac} (and HP, CR), so searching for the words “Armor Class” won’t match anything.

Quick fix: update the monster render text to include the natural-language label:

- - AC: {ac}
- - HP: {hp}
- - CR: {cr}
+ - Armor Class (AC): {ac}
+ - Hit Points (HP): {hp}
+ - Challenge Rating (CR): {cr}


That alone will make “Armor Class” searches behave how a human expects.

2) The weird ΓÇª characters in snippets

That’s coming from the FTS snippet(..., '…', ...) using a Unicode ellipsis. In your transcript it’s getting mangled.

Quick fix: make the snippet ellipsis plain ASCII:

- snippet(chunks_fts, 0, '[', ']', '…', 20) AS snip
+ snippet(chunks_fts, 0, '[', ']', '...', 20) AS snip


(Everything else can stay the same.)
